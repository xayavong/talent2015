Hi reader,

I try to make a simple fortran code to set up 
single particle basis for nuclear/neutron matter,
the system is confined in a Fermi sphere (box ?)
of volume LxLxL, in this case the quantum numbers 
characterized sp state are {nx, ny, nz, sz, tz},

( My question : What about orbital angular momentum for this case ?
There is not spin-orbit interaction ? )

However I feel that my code is so flexible, 
I don't know how to determine total number of state for a given Nmax, as well as 
the number of degeneracy of each energy level,
if you know the analytical relation between them please let me know.


Thanks for reading me!
